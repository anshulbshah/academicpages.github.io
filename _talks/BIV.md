Built a deep architecture to extract a temporally consistent video from a motion blurred images. The work is first of its kind as the traditional algorithms extract only a single deblurred image. The model uses a recurrent network built using ConvLSTM cells. Submitted the work to IEEE Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision 2018 (**CVPR'18**).
