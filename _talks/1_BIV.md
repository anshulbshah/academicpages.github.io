Built a deep architecture to extract a temporally consistent video from a motion blurred images. The work is first of its kind as the traditional algorithms extract only a single deblurred image. The model uses a recurrent network built using ConvLSTM cells. ([Github](https://github.com/anshulbshah/Blurred-Image-to-Video)) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02913))
