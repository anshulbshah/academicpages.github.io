Built a deep architecture to extract a temporally consistent video from a motion blurred images. The work is first of its kind as the traditional algorithms extract only a single deblurred image. The model uses a recurrent network built using ConvLSTM cells. To be submitted to European Conference on Computer Vision, ECCV 2018.
