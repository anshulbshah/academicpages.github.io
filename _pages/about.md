I am a Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University in the department of Computer Science. I am advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/). I am interested in Computer Vision and Image Processing and am currently working on video representation learning. I transferred with my advisor from University of Maryland, College Park working on projects related to pose based action recognition, self-supervised learning and interpretability. I obtained an MS in CS at UMD.

Previously I obtained a B.Tech(Honors) and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. At IIT-M I was working under the guidance of [Prof. A.N Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab) in the area of Image Deblurring and Video Generation.
