I am currently in the final year of B.Tech + M.Tech program in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras. I am doing my Dual Degree project at IPCV lab under the guidance of [Prof. A.N Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/faculty). 

I am passionate about the fields of Computer Vision and Image Processing.
