I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in July 2018 with a B.Tech(Honors) and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering. I will be joining University of Maryland, College Park for a Doctorate in Computer Science with a focus on Computer Vision under Prof. Rama Chellappa.  

I am passionate about the fields of Computer Vision and Image Processing. I did my Dual Degree project at IPCV lab, IIT Madras under the guidance of [Prof. A.N Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/faculty).
